Hello my name is Mohamed Abdiaziz; I was born and currently living in jigjiga.
I recently completed high school though i haven't joined the university, I decided to explore different paths which served me well so far.
I always loved and wanted to know all I can about technology particularly cybersecurity so I started my journey and I am in the middle of CompTIA A+ core 1 and to boost my skill to reach my goal, code and programming are must. 

apart from loving technology, there are other things that I like to do and have their knowledge of such as Arts, photography, videography, digital marketing, branding, IT technician and reading books.
